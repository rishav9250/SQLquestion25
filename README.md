What is an ALIAS command?


Aliases are the temporary names given to a table or column for the purpose of a particular SQL query. It is used when the name of a column or table is used other than its original name, but the modified name is only temporary.

Aliases are created to make table or column names more readable.
The renaming is just a temporary change and the table name does not change in the original database.
Aliases are useful when table or column names are big or not very readable.
These are preferred when there is more than one table involved in a query.
